## About Me

I am currently building a hybrid professional profile that integrates **Electrical Power Systems Engineering**, **advanced mathematical modeling**, and **Data Science / Machine Learning**.

I am particularly passionate about applying **data-driven methods**—such as machine learning, statistical modeling, and time series analysis—to traditional power systems problems, including load analysis, system operation, fault detection, and optimization.

My work focuses on translating engineering knowledge into **reproducible Python-based models**, bridging the gap between classical engineering approaches and modern data science techniques.
